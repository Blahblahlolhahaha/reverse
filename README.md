# Malware Analysis

So I decided to do this cos malware do be fun to analyse ;D

All chapters will be based on the book Practical Malware Analysis where the book is in this repo.

Labs can be downloaded online easily hahahaha

Updates are done when I am free :D

Will do legit malware when I feel like I'm ready 

Gonna skip chapter 5 because I am too broke for IDA Pro T.T
